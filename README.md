## Introduction

Coneflip is a Twitch overlay game designed to add fun interactivity to your stream. Originally created for the Twitch streamer [aquaismissing](https://www.twitch.tv/aquaismissing) by [DrippyCatCS](https://x.com/drippycatcs) and [Aquaismissing](https://x.com/aquaismissing), Coneflip now leverages Twitch API endpoints to power its interactive features. The primary interfaces are the cone gameplay window and the leaderboard view, which are integrated into your streaming setup via OBS.

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit a pull request with enhancements or bug fixes!

## Adding and Managing Skins

### Adding a New Skin

> **Note**
> You can find a list to all included skins [here](https://drippycatcs.github.io/coneflip-overlay/commands#-cone-skins).

1. **Add the Skin Image:**  
   Place your skin image into the `public/skins/` directory.

2. **Update the Configuration:**  
   Edit the `public/skins/config.json` file to add a new skin entry. For example:

    ```json
    {
      "name": "your_skin_name",
      "visuals": "your_skin_image_filename",
      "canUnbox": true,
      "unboxWeight": 0
    }
    ```

   - Set `"canUnbox"` to `false` if you do not want the skin to be unboxable.
   - To add a ‚ÄúHOLO‚Äù texture, prefix the image filename with `holo_`.
